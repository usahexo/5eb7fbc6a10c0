It is a great game to play with friends and can be quite exciting. There are a few different variants of poker, but the most popular one is Texas Hold’em. In this article, we will take a look at the best way to play poker and the order of poker hands.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know when playing poker is the hand rankings. The highest ranking hand is called a royal flush and it consists of ace, king, queen, jack, and ten, all of the same suit. The second highest ranking hand is called a straight flush and it consists of five consecutive cards of the same suit. The next highest ranking hand is called four of a kind and it consists of four cards of the same rank. Following that is a full house which consists of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. After that is a flush which consists of five cards of the same suit that are not in any particular order. The next highest ranking hand is called a straight which consists of five consecutive cards that are not all the same suit. The lowest ranking hand is two pair which consists of two cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. Finally, the lowest ranking hand possible is a single card, which is also known as high card.</p>
<p>Now that you know about the different rankings for hands in poker, let’s take a look at the best way to play each type of hand. When you are starting out in poker, it’s best to keep things simple and only play hands that have a high probability of winning. The best way to play these types of hands is by following this simple guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you have two pair or better, always raise</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have three or fourof a kind, always raise</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have an ace&#x2F;king or better, always raise</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="What-are-the-Poker-Hands-in-Order"><a href="#What-are-the-Poker-Hands-in-Order" class="headerlink" title="What are the Poker Hands in Order?"></a>What are the Poker Hands in Order?</h1><p>Poker is a popular card game that involves betting and skill. The goal is to assemble the best five-card poker hand possible, using any combination of your two down cards and the five community cards.</p>
<p>There are numerous poker hands in order, and beginners may find it difficult to remember them all. That’s why we’ve put together this comprehensive guide to the best poker hands.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the ten best hands in poker, starting with the highest-ranking hand and working our way down:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Royal Flush: A royal flush is a straight flush made up of the ace, king, queen, jack and ten of a single suit. This is the highest-ranking poker hand and beats all other hands in the game.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Straight Flush: A straight flush is five consecutive cards of the same suit. This hand ranks below a royal flush but still beats most other hands.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Four of a Kind: A four of a kind is four cards of the same rank. This hand ranks below a straight flush but above three of a kind.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Full House: A full house is three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. This hand ranks below four of a kind but above two pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Flush: A flush is any five cards of the same suit. This hand ranks below a full house but above three of a kind.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Straight: A straight is five consecutive cards not all of the same suit. This hand ranks below a flush but above three of a kind.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank make up this hand, which ranks below a straight but above two pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two Pairs: Two pairs constitute this hand, with each pair being two different card ranks. This hand ranks below three of a kind but above one pair.</p>
</li>
<li><p>One Pair: One pair equals two cards of the same rank, making this the lowest-ranking poker hand possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="Poker-Hands-in-Order-Learn-How-to-Play-Like-a-Pro"><a href="#Poker-Hands-in-Order-Learn-How-to-Play-Like-a-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Poker Hands in Order: Learn How to Play Like a Pro"></a>Poker Hands in Order: Learn How to Play Like a Pro</h1><p>In poker, the strength of your hand is based on the combination of five cards that you are dealt. There are many combinations possible, and in this article we will go over the order of poker hands from strongest to weakest.</p>
<p>Straight Flush: This is the best hand in poker and consists of five consecutive cards all of the same suit. If two players have a straight flush, the player with the highest card within the sequence wins.</p>
<p>Four of a Kind: This is made up of four cards of the same rank, with one random card thrown in to complete the hand. If two players have four of a kind, the player with the highest rank wins.</p>
<p>Full House: This hand contains three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. If two players have full houses, the player with three matching cards (the “triple”) wins.</p>
<p>Flush: A flush is made up of five cards all of the same suit, but not in consecutive order. If two players have flushes, the player with the highest ranked card in their flush wins.</p>
<p>Straight: A straight is composed of five consecutively ranked cards, but not all of the same suit. If two players have a straight, the player with the highest ranking card wins.</p>
<p>Three of a Kind: This hand has three cards of one rank and two filler cards. If two players have three-of-a-kinds, then whoever has the highest ranking three-of-a-kind wins.</p>
<p>Two Pair: Two pair consists of two different pairs and any fifth card. The higher pair beats lower pair if both players have two pair. For example, if one player has Aces &amp; Kings while another has 2s &amp; 7s, then the first player would win since their Aces are higher than 2s.</p>
<h1 id="The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Poker-Hands-How-to-Play-Each-One"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Poker-Hands-How-to-Play-Each-One" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Guide to Poker Hands: How to Play Each One"></a>The Ultimate Guide to Poker Hands: How to Play Each One</h1><p>In poker, hands are rank according to their strength. The strongest hand is a royal flush, followed by a straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind and then two pair. The weakest hand is high card.</p>
<p>If you’re playing heads-up (against one other player), the hands are rank according to the following:</p>
<p>Pair &gt; Two pair &gt; Three of a kind &gt; Straight &gt; Flush &gt; Full house &gt; Four of a kind &gt; Straight flush &gt; Royal flush</p>
<p>If there are more than two players involved in the hand, the ranking starts over again with pairs. So if you have three players in a hand and someone has two pair, the player with three of a kind is the highest-ranking hand. If two players have three of a kind, then the rank is decided by the highest-ranking card within those three cards. Aces are high and 2s are low.</p>
<p>Okay, so now you know how hands are rank in poker - but how do you actually play each type? Let’s take a look:</p>
<h1 id="Royal-Flush"><a href="#Royal-Flush" class="headerlink" title="Royal Flush"></a>Royal Flush</h1><p>The ultimate dream hand in poker - formed when you have all five cards of the same suit (clubs, diamonds, hearts or spades). To make this hand, you need an ace, king, queen, jack and ten of that suit. There is only one possible royal flush in any given suit - so if someone else already has it, your best option is to fold!</p>
<h1 id="Straight-Flush"><a href="#Straight-Flush" class="headerlink" title="Straight Flush"></a>Straight Flush</h1><p>A straight flush is made up of five consecutive cards of the same suit. Again, this is only possible with one particular suit - so if someone else has all five cards of that suit (a royal flush), your best option is to fold!</p>
<pre><code>  # Four of a Kind 
</code></pre>
<p>Four cards of the same rank make up a four of a kind. This can be any rank from 2s all the way up to Aces. If you’re playing against more than one player, whoever has the highest-ranking four of a kind wins. If there’s a tie (e.g. two people have 4 Kings), then the fifth card (the kicker) decides who wins. </p>
<pre><code># Full House
</code></pre>
<p>A full house consists of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank - for example 3 Kings and 2 Queens or 4 Jacks and 1 King. The ranking for full houses is decided according to the higher ranking triplet - so in our examples 3 Kings would beat 4 Jacks. If there’s still a tie then the suits are compared (using standard order: clubs &lt; diamonds &lt; hearts &lt; spades) until there’s a winner.</p>
<h1 id="Flush"><a href="#Flush" class="headerlink" title="Flush"></a>Flush</h1><p>A flush consists of five cards all from the same suit but not in consecutive order. So for example 2 clubs 3 hearts 4 clubs 5 spades would be classed as a flush as they are all clubs but not in consecutive order (2 3 4 5). Ranking for flushes works exactly like full houses - compare the higher ranking triplet first and then compare suits if they’re still tied.</p>
<h1 id="Straight"><a href="#Straight" class="headerlink" title="Straight"></a>Straight</h1><p>A straight consists of five consecutive cards not all from the same suit e.g 6 diamonds 7 clubs 8 hearts 9 spades would be classed as a straight as they are all different suits but in consecutive order (6 7 8 9). In case of multiple straights at showdown,the one with higher top card wins e .g 9 clubs 10 spades J clubs Q hearts would beat 6 diamonds 7 clubs 8 hearts 9 spades .Straightflush beats every thing except royalflush .</p>
<h1 id="Threeofakind"><a href="#Threeofakind" class="headerlink" title="Threeofakind"></a>Threeofakind</h1><p>Threeofakind consistsof threecardsoftherankandonecardof anotherrank .For example7diamonds ,8spades ,9heartswouldbeac Threeofakind .Ifyouaretplayingagainstmorethanoneplayerthehighestthreeofakindwins .</p>
