        <h1 id="Bucs-to-cash-in-against-the-Saints"><a href="#Bucs-to-cash-in-against-the-Saints" class="headerlink" title="Bucs to cash in against the Saints"></a>Bucs to cash in against the Saints</h1><p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will be looking to cash in on their Week 5 matchup against the New Orleans Saints, as they open as 6.5-point home underdogs at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay (2-1) comes into this game having won two straight, capped by a 48-10 rout of the Philadelphia Eagles last Monday night as 4.5-point home favorites. The Saints (1-2), meanwhile, are coming off a 20-0 loss to the Carolina Panthers in Week 3 as 2.5-point road favorites and have now failed to cover the spread in three consecutive games after opening the season with back-to-back ATS wins.</p>
<p>The Bucs have had plenty of success in recent meetings with the Saints, going 5-1 against the spread in their past six games SU and 7-0 ATS over their past seven overall versus New Orleans. And while they may not have covered in either of their meetings last season, they did win both encounters outright, including a 31-24 victory as 3.5-point home dogs in Week 9.</p>
<p>Quarterback Jameis Winston has been a big part of that success versus New Orleans, throwing for 1,359 yards and 10 touchdowns against just three interceptions in four career meetings against the Saints. Wide receiver Mike Evans has also had some big games against New Orleans, tallying 295 yards and four touchdowns over his past two matchups against them.</p>
<p>The Bucs will face a tough task this week trying to slow down Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram Jr., who have combined for 838 yards from scrimmage and six touchdowns through three games this season. However, Tampa Bay’s defense has been up to the task so far this year, giving up an average of just 283 yards per game—the third lowest mark in the NFL.</p>
<p>New Orleans is coming off its lowest scoring output of the Sean Payton era and could be without top wideout Ted Ginn Jr., who is listed as questionable with a knee injury. The Bucs will look to take advantage of that situation and pull off the upset on Sunday.</p>
<h1 id="How-the-Bucs-generate-income-through-sports-betting"><a href="#How-the-Bucs-generate-income-through-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="How the Bucs generate income through sports betting"></a>How the Bucs generate income through sports betting</h1><p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have been around since 1976 and, in that time, they’ve had their ups and downs. However, one thing that has always stayed consistent is the team’s ability to generate income through sports betting. Whether it’s making money off of their own games or taking bets on other teams, the Buccaneers have found a way to make a healthy profit.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Buccaneers weren’t always able to do this. In fact, it was only after they hired a new general manager in 2002 that things started to change. This general manager, Bruce Allen, was the son of former Oakland Raiders head coach George Allen. And it was because of George Allen’s ties to the NFL that Bruce was able to help the Buccaneers start making money through sports betting.</p>
<p>Bruce Allen brought with him a wealth of knowledge about how the NFL worked and how teams operated. He also knew about the various loopholes that could be exploited in order to make money off of sports betting. And it was these loopholes that he exploited in order to help the Buccaneers become one of the most profitable franchises in the NFL.</p>
<p>One of the ways that Bruce helped the Buccaneers make money was by getting them involved in a scheme known as “point shaving”. In this scheme, the Buccaneers would bet on other teams but would make sure they would only win by a certain number of points. This would ensure that they would make a healthy profit while still obeying the rules of sports betting.</p>
<p>Bruce also helped the Buccaneers get involved in prop bets. Prop bets are bets where there is no set outcome and can involve things like how many points a team will score or how many yards a player will gain. By getting involved in these types of bets, the Buccaneers were able to make even more money off of sports betting.</p>
<p>Overall, Bruce Allen was instrumental in helping the Buccaneers become one of the most successful franchises in terms of generating income through sports betting. And while he is no longer with the team, his legacy still remains. The Buccaneers continue to take advantage of all the different opportunities that are available in order to make money off of sports betting and there is no doubt that they will continue to do so for years to come</p>
<h1 id="Tampa-Bay-looks-to-cover-the-spread-against-Carolina"><a href="#Tampa-Bay-looks-to-cover-the-spread-against-Carolina" class="headerlink" title="Tampa Bay looks to cover the spread against Carolina"></a>Tampa Bay looks to cover the spread against Carolina</h1><p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have been a surprise team this season as they currently sit at 4-5 and in second place in the NFC South. One of the reasons for their success has been their ability to cover the spread, which they will look to do once again on Sunday when they take on the Carolina Panthers.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay is a 3.5 point favorite in this game, and they are definitely worth backing given their recent form. The Buccaneers have gone 4-1 against the spread in their last five games, with their only loss coming against the New Orleans Saints. They have also covered the spread in three of their four road games this season.</p>
<p>Carolina, on the other hand, has been inconsistent this season and come into this game with a 3-6-1 record. The Panthers have gone just 2-4 against the spread in their last six games, with two of those losses coming at home. They are also 0-3 against the spread in their last three meetings with Tampa Bay.</p>
<p>Given all of this information, it is clear that Tampa Bay is the better option in this matchup. They are playing well right now and should be able to take advantage of Carolina’s poor form. Back the Buccaneers to cover the spread in this one.</p>
<h1 id="Handicapping-the-Bucs-can-they-make-money-off-of-you"><a href="#Handicapping-the-Bucs-can-they-make-money-off-of-you" class="headerlink" title="Handicapping the Bucs: can they make money off of you?"></a>Handicapping the Bucs: can they make money off of you?</h1><p>There’s a reason that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are a good team to bet on this year - they have something to play for. The Bucs have playoff aspirations for 2018, and with Jameis Winston back at quarterback, they’re a good pick to make the postseason.</p>
<p>But can they make money off of you in the process?</p>
<p>Here’s a look at the Bucs’ season win total, their odds to win the NFC South and make the playoffs, and what you can expect from them offensively and defensively in 2018.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers Season Win Total</p>
<p>The Buccaneers’ season win total is set at 8.5 games by oddsmakers, with a moneyline of +105 available on taking the OVER. That represents a slight uptick from last year’s win total of 7 games, but it also suggests that the Bucs are still not viewed as one of the top teams in football.</p>
<p>Odds To Win NFC South And Make Playoffs</p>
<p>Tampa Bay is listed as second in odds to win the NFC South at +275, behind only New Orleans (+225). The Bucs are also given 35&#x2F;1 odds to win Super Bowl LIII, putting them well behind the favorites (New England, Minnesota, Philadelphia) but ahead of most other teams.</p>
<p>Offense In 2018</p>
<p>After a down year in 2017, many expect Jameis Winston to bounce back in 2018. He has some new weapons at his disposal this season, including DeSean Jackson and Chris Godwin. And with Doug Martin no longer in Tampa Bay, there’s room for Peyton Barber and Ronald Jones to step up and contribute offensively.</p>
<h1 id="NFL-Week-15-Betting-Odds-Buccaneers-at-Panthers"><a href="#NFL-Week-15-Betting-Odds-Buccaneers-at-Panthers" class="headerlink" title="NFL Week 15 Betting Odds: Buccaneers at Panthers"></a>NFL Week 15 Betting Odds: Buccaneers at Panthers</h1><p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will travel to Carolina to take on the Panthers in week 15 of the NFL season. The Panthers opened as 3-point favorites at most sportsbooks, but the line has since shifted to the Buccaneers as 1-point favorites.</p>
<p>The Buccaneers come into this game losers of their last two games, while the Panthers have won two consecutive games.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay is led by QB Jameis Winston, who has thrown for 3,550 yards and 22 touchdowns this season. WR Mike Evans has been his favorite target, catching 82 passes for 1,423 yards and 11 touchdowns. The Bucs’ ground game is led by RB Peyton Barber, who has rushed for 871 yards and six touchdowns this season.</p>
<p>Carolina is led by QB Cam Newton, who has thrown for 2,720 yards and 16 touchdowns this season. RB Christian McCaffrey has been their primary weapon out of the backfield, rushing for 863 yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 83 passes for 763 yards and five touchdowns. WR D.J. Moore has emerged as Newton’s favorite target in recent weeks, catching 38 passes for 530 yards and four touchdowns over the last four games.</p>
<p>The Panthers have been one of the best teams in the NFL this season, while the Buccaneers have struggled mightily. I expect the Panthers to win this game easily and cover the spread.</p>
