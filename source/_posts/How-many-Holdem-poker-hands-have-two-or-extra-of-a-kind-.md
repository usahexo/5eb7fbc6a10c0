#  How to spot cheating at poker – and win!

There are a few tells when it comes to spotting cheating at poker, and if you can learn to recognise them, you’ll have a big advantage over your opponents. So, in this article, we’re going to take a look at some of the most common ways cheats attempt to win at poker, and how you can stay one step ahead.

One of the most common methods used by cheats is collusion. This is where two or more players work together in order to cheat their opponents. They might agree to split their profits evenly, or one player might deliberately lose in order to help the other player win. There are a few ways to spot collusion, including watching for suspicious betting patterns and looking out for players who seem to be working together.

Another common way for cheats to win at poker is by using marked cards. These cards have been tampered with in some way, usually by adding marks or symbols that can be seen only by the cheats. There are a few ways to spot marked cards, such as checking for symmetry on the back of the cards or looking out for unusual markings.

Finally, another method commonly used by cheats is card switching. This is where the cheat changes the cards in their hand with those from the deck, usually just before showdown. There are a few ways to spot card switching, such as looking out for players who constantly seem to be drawing new cards or checking for mismatches between which cards have been played and which remain in the deck.
