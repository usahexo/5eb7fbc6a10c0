#  Ready, set, bet: Mobile sports betting coming to a device near you in NY!

After months of anticipation and speculation, mobile sports betting in New York is finally becoming a reality. The state Gaming Commission has awarded licenses to both DraftKings and FanDuel, paving the way for these companies to offer their services via mobile app.

This move comes as no surprise – both companies have been lobbying heavily for the right to offer sports betting in New York. In anticipation of the decision, they have already been making arrangements with casinos and other potential partners in order to be ready to go once the green light is given.

For now, it’s still unclear exactly when mobile sports betting will be available in the state. However, officials estimate that it could be up and running within the next few months. In the meantime, those interested can sign up on the websites of DraftKings or FanDuel to receive updates on when it becomes available.

So what can New Yorkers expect from mobile sports betting? Essentially, it will work much like traditional sports betting – people will be able to place bets on games either through a website or an app. The main difference is that it can be done from anywhere, as long as you have an internet or data connection.

This opens up a lot of possibilities for New Yorkers who want to get into sports betting but don’t have time to go to a casino or racetrack. With mobile betting, they can place bets whenever and wherever is convenient for them. And since both DraftKings and FanDuel already have extensive user bases, there’s sure to be plenty of excitement around this new development.

So far, only New Jersey has legalized mobile sports betting in the US. But with more states likely to follow suit in the coming months and years, this could be just the beginning of a major upheaval in the world of online gambling. So keep an eye out for announcements from your favorite gambling sites – chances are they’ll be offering mobile sports betting sooner rather than later!

#  Get in the game: Mobile sports betting coming to New York!

Mobile sports betting is coming to New York, just in time for the start of the NFL season! Governor Cuomo has announced that starting September 1st, New Yorkers will be able to place bets on their favorite teams using their smartphones.

This is great news for fans of sports betting, who have been waiting for years for this type of service to become available in the state. Now they can place bets while watching the game on TV, or even when they're out and about.

What's more,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) mobile sports betting is expected to generate millions of dollars in new revenue for the state. That's good news for New Yorkers who are looking for ways to boost the economy, and it's also good news for the NY gambling industry, which is currently struggling to keep up with competition from other states.

So far, it's not clear how much New Yorkers will have to pay in fees to use the mobile sports betting service. However, given that other states with similar services charge around 10%, it's likely that New York will also charge a fee in order to cover costs.

Regardless of the cost, it's clear that mobile sports betting is a win-win situation for everyone involved. Fans get a new way to enjoy their favorite pastime, the state gets extra revenue, and the gambling industry gets a much-needed boost. It's exciting news, and we can't wait to see how it plays out!
