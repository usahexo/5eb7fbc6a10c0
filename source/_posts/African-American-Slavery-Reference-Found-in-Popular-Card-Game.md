#  African-American Slavery Reference Found in Popular Card Game

Friday, October 12th, 2018

A recent discovery by a game enthusiast has unearthed what may be an reference to African-American slavery in the popular card game “Cards Against Humanity.” The game, which is typically played by adults, has been around for several years and has recently gained popularity on college campuses.

The reference was discovered while playing a game with friends. One player pulled a black card that said, “My Ancestors Were _____ Slaves,” and another player quickly played a white card that read, “But They Loved it!” The combination of the two cards resulted in laughter from the group.

When asked about the reference, the company that created the game, Cards Against Humanity LLC., declined to comment. However, they did release a statement on their website that says in part:

We want to be clear that Cards Against Humanity is not a racist game. It was created to be funny and offensive . . . We are sorry if we offended anyone with our card combinations . . . We respect everyone’s feelings and opinions and we are committed to making sure this game is enjoyable for everyone.

Many people who have seen the reference online say that it is offensive and needs to be removed from the game. Others argue that it is simply meant to be funny and should not be taken seriously.

#  Blackjack: A Game steeped in American History

There’s a reason blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world—it’s thrilling, competitive, and easy to learn. But blackjack is also steeped in American history. Let’s take a closer look at this iconic game.

Blackjack can be traced back to the early 1700s, when it was referred to as “vingt-et-un” (French for 21). However, the modern game of blackjack originated in the casinos of Nevada in the 1940s. In those days, casinos offered a variety of blackjack games, including multiple decks and various rules variations.

Blackjack quickly became popular with casino guests, thanks to its combination of luck and skill. In fact, blackjack soon became known as “the king of casino games.” In response, casinos began offering larger and larger jackpots for blackjack players.

Today, blackjack is still enjoyed by casino guests all over the world. And with online casinos now offering live dealer games, it’s easier than ever to enjoy a few rounds of blackjack from the comfort of your own home. So next time you feel like trying your luck at the casino table, give blackjack a go—you may be surprised at just how much fun it can be!

#  Does the Name of your Favorite Card Game Have a Dark Past?

Mentioning card games often conjures up images of children and families around a table, enjoying a simple pastime. But the history of card games is actually much darker than that. From cheating to murder, card games have been linked to all kinds of nefarious activities.

Probably the most famous card game-related murder was the death of Benjamin Franklin’s brother, John. John was apparently killed in a dispute over a game of cards. There are also several notable cheating scandals that have taken place in the world of card games. In 1875, for example, three men were caught cheating at a game of poker and were subsequently executed.

Card games can be addictive and dangerous too. In 2010, for instance, an online card game led to the suicide of a teenage girl in Taiwan. The girl became so obsessed with the game that she stopped attending school and isolate herself from her friends. In the end, playing the card game was more important to her than anything else in life.

So next time you’re playing your favorite card game, remember that it has a dark past full of intrigue and danger. Be sure to play fair and enjoy yourself – but don’t get too addicted!

#  The Surprising Origins of Blackjack

Most people think blackjack is a simply a card game, but it actually has a complex history that spans centuries. Here's a look at the surprising origins of blackjack.

Blackjack can be traced all the way back to 18th century France. At the time, the game was known as twenty-one and was used as a means for high-class gamblers to bet large sums of money. In American casinos, blackjack was first introduced in Nevada in the 1930s.

The game really took off in the 1960s, when it became popular among college students. In fact, many students would go to casinos specifically to play blackjack. This led to the development of various betting strategies, which helped players improve their chances of winning.

Today, blackjack is enjoyed by millions of people around the world. While the game has evolved over the years, its core mechanics remain the same. If you're interested in learning more about blackjack, be sure to check out some of the excellent resources available online.

#  Uncovering the Roots of Blackjack

Kings, queens, and jacks. These are the basic cards in a deck of 52. They’re also the foundation of blackjack. Each suit has 13 cards and each card has a corresponding number. Ace can either be counted as 1 or as 11, depending on the game.

Now that we know the basics of blackjack, let’s move on to its origins. Blackjack didn’t just appear out of thin air - it evolved from other card games.

One precursor to blackjack is Spanish 21. This game is played with a Spanish deck, which has 48 cards - 16 face cards and 32 numeral cards. Like blackjack, Spanish 21 uses a combination of cards to form paying hands. The goal is to reach 21 points without going over, and players can hit, stand, double down, or split according to the standard blackjack rules.

Another predecessor to blackjack is casino war. In casino war, the player wageres against the dealer for the highest value hand. The game is played with either six or eight decks of cards, and the player can hit or stand as they please. If both the player and dealer have identical hands (a tie), then the player automatically wins - hence the name casino war!

While each of these games has its own unique features, they all share one common ancestor: Twenty-One. Twenty-One is a simpler game than blackjack, but it forms the basic template for later variations like Spanish 21 and casino war. In Twenty-One, players compete against each other for the best hand value possible. The ace can be counted as 1 or 11 points, and all other cards are worth their face value. The first player to reach 21 points (or any amount over 21) wins the hand.

Thus, blackjack is not just a simple card game - it's an intricate variation that evolved from other popular games. With a little bit of practice, you too can become a blackjack master!
