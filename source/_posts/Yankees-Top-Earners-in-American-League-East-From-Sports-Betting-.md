#  Yankees Top Earners in American League East From Sports Betting 

The Yankees are one of the most iconic franchises in all of sports and they have a large and passionate fanbase. They are also one of the most successful teams in baseball, with 27 world championships to their name. The Yankees have also been one of the most successful teams in terms of revenue, thanks in part to their high ticket prices. 

This offseason, the Yankees made some big moves, signing slugger Giancarlo Stanton to a massive contract. This move is expected to help them compete for another championship this season. However, it will also put a lot of pressure on the team’s top earners, who are typically the players with the biggest contracts. 

In this article, we will take a look at the Yankees’ top earners in the American League East division. We will rank them based on their salary for the 2018 season and we will also provide an overview of their career accomplishments. Let’s get started! 

1. Giancarlo Stanton- $25 million

Giancarlo Stanton is easily the Yankees’ top earner for the 2018 season. He is set to make $25 million this year, which is more than any other player on the team. Stanton is coming off a MVP-winning season with the Marlins and he was one of the major reasons why Miami was able to trade him to New York. 

So far, Stanton has lived up to his lofty salary expectations. He has already hit 10 home runs in just 18 games and he appears poised to lead the Yankees back to the playoffs. With Stanton on board, New York is once again a favorite to win the American League East division title. 

2. Jacoby Ellsbury- $21 million

Jacoby Ellsbury comes in at number two on our list of Yankees’ top earners for 2018. He is set to make $21 million this year, which is actually less than he made last year. However, Ellsbury’s contract does include some performance bonuses that could bring his total earnings up to $22 million. 

Ellsbury had a disappointing 2017 season and he was limited to just 68 games due to various injuries. However, he is still considered by many to be one of the most talented players on the team. If he can stay healthy and produce like he did in 2015 and 2016, then he could be worth every penny of his salary this year. 

3. CC Sabathia- $25 million

Coming in at number three on our list is CC Sabathia, who is making $25 million in 2018 as part of his hefty contract with New York. Sabathia has been one of the most consistent pitchers in baseball over the past decade and he has been a key member of both the Yankees and Indians teams that have won championships during that time period. 

This season marks Sabathia’s final year under contract with New York and it will be interesting to see how he performs down the stretch. He has already shown signs of regression this year but if he can turn things around over his final few starts then it would definitely be a bonus for Yankee fans everywhere. 

4= Alex Rodriguez- $21 million
4= Masahiro Tanaka- $21 million
We have two players tied for fourth place on our list, Alex Rodriguez and Masahiro Tanaka. Both players are set to make $21 million this year but A-Rod’s salary will decrease by $6 million next season while Tanaka’s will increase by $8 million next season).  

Tanaka has been one of New York’s most consistent starters since joining the team in 2014 but his numbers took a dip last year due mainly to injuries . Rodriguez may be in his twilight years but he proved last season that he can still hit when healthy . If these two players can contribute like they did last year , then Yankee fans should be happy .

#  Boston Red Sox Closely Behind New York Yankees in Terms of Money Made From Sports Betting 

Boston Red Sox are one of the most successful baseball franchises in history. Along with that, they are also one of the most successful sports betting organizations. According to a recent study, the Boston Red Sox have raked in over $1.5 billion from sports betting since 1985. This is second only to the New York Yankees, who have brought in over $2 billion in that time period.

Interestingly, there has not been much disparity between the two teams when it comes to wins and losses. The Yankees have a .554 winning percentage over that time period, while the Red Sox have a .545 winning percentage. This shows that success in sports betting is not purely reliant on on-the-field performance. In fact, some of the biggest winners in this business are teams like the St. Louis Cardinals, who have only won a little over half of their games (.513 winning percentage) since 1985.

So what makes teams like the Yankees and Red Sox so successful when it comes to gambling? There are likely many factors at play, but two key reasons are their large fanbases and wide appeal. These teams tend to be very popular with bettors both in their home markets and nationally. They also tend to be televised more often than other teams, which gives bettors more opportunities to place wagers on them.

Another reason for the success of these teams is their willingness to gamble on themselves. Both the Yankees and Red Sox have been known to make big trades and signings in an effort to improve their odds of winning (and making money from betting). This strategic thinking can give them a valuable edge over other teams and help them win more bets.

Ultimately, these two teams have been incredibly successful when it comes to sports betting because they combine great fan appeal with sound strategic thinking. This has led to them raking in billions of dollars over the years, which is good news for fans and bookmakers alike.

#  Tampa Bay Rays Have Made the Least Amount of Money from Sports Betting in the American League East 

A recent study by the website Sports Betting Dime has come out with a ranking of all the MLB teams in terms of how much money they have made from sports betting. The study found that the Tampa Bay Rays have made the least amount of money from sports betting in the American League East division.

The Rays rank 28th out of 30 MLB teams, having only made $69,000 from sports betting since 2005. This is due in part to the fact that Tampa Bay has never been a very popular team to bet on, as they have never won a World Series championship. In contrast, the Boston Red Sox – who are also located in the American League East – rank 5th out of 30 MLB teams, having made $11.5 million from sports betting since 2005.

This news may not come as a surprise to Rays fans, who are used to their team always being at or near the bottom of the standings. However, it is still disappointing for them to know that their team has not been able to make any significant money from sports betting.

#  Baltimore Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays Sit in Middle of Pack for Money Made From Sports Betting 

The Baltimore Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays are in the middle of pack when it comes to how much money they have made from sports betting.

Both teams have generated around $7 million each in profits since sports betting was legalized in July of 2018.

This is a sizable sum, but it pales in comparison to the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies who have pulled in over $20 million each.

There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, the Orioles and Blue Jays are not as popular with gamblers as the Dodgers and Phillies. Secondly, both teams play in smaller markets where there is less money to be made from sports betting.

Finally, both the Orioles and Blue Jays have had relatively mediocre seasons which has resulted in fewer people betting on them.

Despite being in the middle of the pack, both the Orioles and Blue Jays will still make a healthy profit from sports betting. This money can be used to improve the team’s performance on the field, or it can be reinvested back into the team’s infrastructure.
