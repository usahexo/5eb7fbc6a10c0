#  888 Casino Adds Sports Betting to NJ Platform

888 Casino, a subsidiary of the 888 Holdings Plc and one of the world’s most popular online casinos, announced on Thursday the launch of its new sports betting platform in the New Jersey market. The company has been granted an online sports betting license by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.

888 Casino’s sports betting platform offers bettors a wide range of markets, including traditional pre-match bets as well as in-game wagers. Bettors can also take advantage of a wide array of props and special bets.

The 888 Casino Sportsbook is available on desktop and mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets. It is fully integrated with the existing 888Casino account, so players can use their existing login credentials to access it. Players who are not already registered with 888Casino can do so quickly and easily on the site.

“We are excited to enter the New Jersey sports betting market and offer our customers a world-class betting experience,” said Asaf Husidic, Chief Product Officer of 888Casino. “Our sportsbook has been tailored for New Jersey players with features and markets that will appeal to all types of bettors. We look forward to giving our customers a great experience both when they are placing bets and when they are winning big payouts.”

#  888 Casino Adds Sports Betting as New Jersey Gains Regulatory Approval

888 Casino, one of the world’s largest and most popular gambling platforms, has announced it will be expanding its services to include sports betting. The move comes as New Jersey prepares to start accepting bets on sporting events, following the repeal of a federal ban on the activity.

888 Casino is among a select few gambling companies that have received approval from New Jersey gaming regulators to offer sports betting. The company plans to launch its new service in the coming weeks, just in time for the start of the upcoming NFL season.

888 Casino isn’t the only company looking to capitalize on the repeal of PASPA (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act). Since PASPA was overturned in May, a number of other casino operators, including MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment, have also announced plans to offer sports betting.

Sports betting is expected to be a major boon for the casino industry. A report from Eilers & Krejcik Gaming estimates that sports betting could generate up to $6 billion in annual revenue for casinos nationwide. In Nevada, where sports betting has been legal for some time, such bets accounted for more than $500 million in revenue last year.

Not everyone is happy about the repeal of PASPA, however. Some critics worry that the increased availability of sports betting will lead to an increase in gambling addiction and other social ills. Others argue that legalization will simply serve to line the pockets of casino operators while doing nothing to benefit consumers or athletes.

#  888 Casino Launches Sports Betting in New Jersey Ahead of NBA Finals

888 Casino announced the launch of its sports betting operation in New Jersey on Monday, just ahead of the start of the NBA Finals. The company said that its new sportsbook is available both online and through its app.

"We're thrilled to offer our players a top-class betting experience as they root for their favorite teams during this year's NBA Finals," 888 Casino spokesperson Kaaren Aberg said in a statement. "Our industry-leading technology offers players a great range of bets, as well as real-time information and insights so they can make informed decisions."

888 Casino is one of several gambling companies that have launched or announced plans to launch sports betting in New Jersey since the state legalized the activity in early 2018. Monmouth Park, which is operated by the New Jersey Racing Commission, was the first casino to offer sports betting in the state when it opened its book on May 28.

The NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and Toronto Raptors get underway on Thursday night.

# How to Choose the Right NJ Online Casino for You

When you’re looking for an online casino in New Jersey, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. Not all casinos are created equal, and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. So how do you choose the right casino for you?

First, think about what kind of games you want to play. Some casinos have more slots than table games, while others focus on blackjack and other traditional casino games. If you want to play slots exclusively, then a casino with a large selection of slots is probably right for you. But if you want to play table games as well, then you should look for a casino with a good variety of table games.

Next, think about your budget. Most NJ online casinos have welcome bonuses that give new players free money to play with, but not all casinos are created equal when it comes to bonus amounts. Some casinos have lower bonus caps than others, so make sure you find one that fits your budget.

Finally, think about which casino has the best loyalty program for you. All NJ online casinos offer loyalty programs that reward players for their regular play, but not all loyalty programs are created equal. Some casinos have better rewards than others, so make sure you find one that offers good value for your money.

#  888 Casino Enters New Jersey Market with Sports Betting

888 Casino has recently announced their intentions to expand into the New Jersey gambling market. This new development comes as sports betting is legalized in the state, making it the third US jurisdiction to allow regulated wagering on sporting events. 

888 Casino, which is headquartered in Gibraltar, already operates in a number of jurisdictions around the world and is one of the most well-known and respected online casinos. The company has announced that it will offer both online and mobile sports betting services when it launches in New Jersey.

According to a spokesperson for 888 Casino, the company is excited about entering the New Jersey market and believes that its products will be well received by gamers in the state. He also noted that 888 Casino intends to be a major player in the New Jersey sports betting market and plans to invest heavily in marketing its products there.

Sports betting is currently available at a number of brick-and-mortar establishments in New Jersey, including casinos and racetracks. However, with 888 Casino's entry into the market, online and mobile Sports Betting will now be readily available to New Jersey residents.

888 Casino isn't the only company looking to capitalize on this new opportunity; several other big names in the casino industry have also announced their intentions to offer sports betting services in New Jersey. These include Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts International, and Golden Nugget Atlantic City.

It remains to be seen how successful these companies will be in attracting customers away from the already established brick-and-mortar sportsbooks in New Jersey. But with such a large pool of potential players, it's likely that all of these companies will do quite well.
