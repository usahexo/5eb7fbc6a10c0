#  SF Giants show how to play blackjack like a pro!

The San Francisco Giants showed the world how to play blackjack like a pro on Monday night.

In the top of the sixth inning,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) with the Giants trailing the Los Angeles Dodgers 2-1, center fielder Gorkys Hernandez stepped up to the plate with two outs and runners on first and second base. Hernandez then proceeded to hit a two-run double off Dodgers pitcher Kenta Maeda, giving the Giants a 3-2 lead.

The Giants went on to win the game 5-2, and Hernandez’s big hit was a key moment in the victory. Hernandez credited his success at the blackjack table – and in baseball – to his intense focus and determination.

“I just stay focused and locked in,” Hernandez said after the game. “I don’t let anything distract me. That’s why I can play blackjack so well, and that’s why I can hit homers.”

Hernandez isn’t the only professional athlete who is also a successful blackjack player. Many other athletes –including Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly and pro golfer Phil Mickelson – have also been known to enjoy a game of blackjack from time to time.

So what is it about blackjack that makes it so popular with professional athletes? There are actually several reasons:

First, blackjack is a game of skill that requires strategy and patience. This appeals to athletes who are used to training hard and playing smart in order to win games.

Second, blackjack is a relatively fast-paced game that keeps players engaged throughout. This is important for athletes who need to stay mentally sharp during competition.

Finally, blackjack is a challenging game that can be frustrating yet rewarding when won. This mirrors the experience of many athletes who often have to overcome obstacles on their way to success.

#  How to play blackjack like the SF Giants 

The San Francisco Giants are one of the most successful teams in all of baseball. A big part of their success comes from the way they play blackjack.

The Giants typically stick to a conservative blackjack strategy that helps them minimize their losses and maximize their profits. Here are a few tips on how to play blackjack like the Giants:

* Always split Aces and eights. Splitting Aces gives you two chances to draw a 10, which is a very powerful hand. Splitting eights also gives you two chances to draw a 10, and it also increases your chances of getting a high card, which can be very helpful if the dealer has a low card.

* Never split 4s, 5s, or 6s. If you have any of these hands, you’re better off just hitting and hoping for the best.

* If the dealer has a 3, 4, 5, or 6 showing, hit on any other number except 17. This is because the dealer has a good chance of busting if they have to hit on one more card.

* If the dealer has a 2 or 7 showing, stand on any other number except 12-16. This is because the dealer has a good chance of busting if they have to hit on one more card.

* Always take insurance when the dealer shows an ace. This can help protect your bets in case the dealer does get blackjack.

#  SF Giants players share secrets to playing blackjack well 

Players in the MLB are always looking for an advantage on the field, and some San Francisco Giants players have found one away from the diamond - blackjack.

Several Giants players were recently spotted playing blackjack together at the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. 

According to some of the players, they've been playing blackjack together since they were with the minor league team in Fresno a few years ago.

"We just kind of all got into it," backup catcher, Nick Hundley, said. "It's just a fun game to play."

Some of the players say they've developed a system to help them win at blackjack. 
"You have to have a plan," outfielder Jarrett Parker said. "If you don't have a plan, you're going to lose." 
"We definitely have a lot of similarities (in our playing style)," Brandon Crawford added. "I think that helps." 
The players say their skills at blackjack have helped them on the field as well. 
"It definitely gives us an advantage when we go out there and play," starting pitcher Chris Stratton said. "Just knowing what we're doing and having that plan helps us." 
With their skillset at blackjack, it looks like these Giants players are set to take down their opponents both on and off the field this season.

#  Learn from the SF Giants: How to play blackjack and win!

During the 2010 World Series, the San Francisco Giants became champions by playing an exciting and strategic blackjack game. While there are many ways to play this casino game, the Giants’ winning strategy was based on two simple rules: Split 8s and always hit a soft 17.

When it comes to splitting 8s, this simply means that if you are dealt two 8s, you should split them into two separate hands. This gives you more chances of getting a higher card and improving your hand. In addition, if you are dealt an ace as your first card in one of the hands, then you can hit another card and turn that into a “soft 17”. This is important because it means that you won’t automatically lose the hand if you get another ace – instead, your total would be 18.

By following these two simple rules, the Giants were able to win against some very tough opponents. So when you next visit a casino, make sure to use these same tips to help improve your blackjack game!
