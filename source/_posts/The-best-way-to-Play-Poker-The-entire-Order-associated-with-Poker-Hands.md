#  Poker Hands in Order: Learn How to Play Like a Pro

In poker, the strength of your hand is based on the combination of five cards that you are dealt. There are many combinations possible, and in this article we will go over the order of poker hands from strongest to weakest.

Straight Flush: This is the best hand in poker and consists of five consecutive cards all of the same suit. If two players have a straight flush, the player with the highest card within the sequence wins.

Four of a Kind: This is made up of four cards of the same rank, with one random card thrown in to complete the hand. If two players have four of a kind, the player with the highest rank wins.

Full House: This hand contains three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. If two players have full houses, the player with three matching cards (the “triple”) wins.

Flush: A flush is made up of five cards all of the same suit, but not in consecutive order. If two players have flushes, the player with the highest ranked card in their flush wins.

Straight: A straight is composed of five consecutively ranked cards, but not all of the same suit. If two players have a straight, the player with the highest ranking card wins.

Three of a Kind: This hand has three cards of one rank and two filler cards. If two players have three-of-a-kinds, then whoever has the highest ranking three-of-a-kind wins.

Two Pair: Two pair consists of two different pairs and any fifth card. The higher pair beats lower pair if both players have two pair. For example, if one player has Aces & Kings while another has 2s & 7s, then the first player would win since their Aces are higher than 2s.









#  The Ultimate Guide to Poker Hands: How to Play Each One

In poker, hands are rank according to their strength. The strongest hand is a royal flush, followed by a straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind and then two pair. The weakest hand is high card.

If you're playing heads-up (against one other player), the hands are rank according to the following:

Pair > Two pair > Three of a kind > Straight > Flush > Full house > Four of a kind > Straight flush > Royal flush

If there are more than two players involved in the hand, the ranking starts over again with pairs. So if you have three players in a hand and someone has two pair, the player with three of a kind is the highest-ranking hand. If two players have three of a kind, then the rank is decided by the highest-ranking card within those three cards. Aces are high and 2s are low.

Okay, so now you know how hands are rank in poker - but how do you actually play each type? Let's take a look:


# Royal Flush
The ultimate dream hand in poker - formed when you have all five cards of the same suit (clubs, diamonds, hearts or spades). To make this hand, you need an ace, king, queen, jack and ten of that suit. There is only one possible royal flush in any given suit - so if someone else already has it, your best option is to fold!


# Straight Flush
A straight flush is made up of five consecutive cards of the same suit. Again, this is only possible with one particular suit - so if someone else has all five cards of that suit (a royal flush), your best option is to fold!



      # Four of a Kind 
Four cards of the same rank make up a four of a kind. This can be any rank from 2s all the way up to Aces. If you're playing against more than one player, whoever has the highest-ranking four of a kind wins. If there's a tie (e.g. two people have 4 Kings), then the fifth card (the kicker) decides who wins. 

    # Full House
A full house consists of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank - for example 3 Kings and 2 Queens or 4 Jacks and 1 King. The ranking for full houses is decided according to the higher ranking triplet - so in our examples 3 Kings would beat 4 Jacks. If there's still a tie then the suits are compared (using standard order: clubs < diamonds < hearts < spades) until there's a winner.

   # Flush
A flush consists of five cards all from the same suit but not in consecutive order. So for example 2 clubs 3 hearts 4 clubs 5 spades would be classed as a flush as they are all clubs but not in consecutive order (2 3 4 5). Ranking for flushes works exactly like full houses - compare the higher ranking triplet first and then compare suits if they're still tied.

 
  # Straight
A straight consists of five consecutive cards not all from the same suit e.g 6 diamonds 7 clubs 8 hearts 9 spades would be classed as a straight as they are all different suits but in consecutive order (6 7 8 9). In case of multiple straights at showdown,the one with higher top card wins e .g 9 clubs 10 spades J clubs Q hearts would beat 6 diamonds 7 clubs 8 hearts 9 spades .Straightflush beats every thing except royalflush .
