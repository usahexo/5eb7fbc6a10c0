#  How do I get tickets to a game?

There are a few different ways to get tickets to a game. One way is to buy them on the primary or secondary ticket market. Another way is to win them in a lottery or sweepstakes. Finally, you can try to get tickets from the team or players themselves.

The most straightforward way to get tickets is to buy them on the primary or secondary ticket market. The primary ticket market is where the team sells tickets directly to the public. The secondary ticket market is where fans resell their tickets. Tickets on the secondary market tend to be more expensive, but there is also a greater variety of tickets available.

Another way to get tickets is to win them in a lottery or sweepstakes. Lotteries and sweepstakes are popular among fans who want to see popular games or teams but don't have the money to buy tickets on the primary or secondary markets. Lotteries and sweepstakes usually have very few tickets available, so it's important to enter as early as possible.

Finally, you can try to get tickets from the team or players themselves. Teams and players often give away tickets for free or sell them at a discount. This can be a great way to get seats close to the action. However, it can be difficult to find tickets through this method, and teams and players usually only offer tickets for popular games or matchups.

#  Who are the team's most famous players?

The Dodgers team has many famous players, including Kirk Gibson, Magic Johnson, and Sandy Koufax. However, the most famous player in Dodgers history is Jackie Robinson. He was the first African American player in MLB and paved the way for other black players.

#  What division do they play in?

According to the NFL website, the New Orleans Saints play in the NFC South division. The other teams in their division are the Atlanta Falcons, Carolina Panthers, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

#  How do I find the team's schedule?

To find your favorite team's schedule, navigate to the team's website and look for a "schedule" or "calendar" link. Most team websites have an up-to-date schedule on their main page or within the main menu.

If you're looking for historical schedules, some teams have archived schedules on their websites. You can also check out ESPN, CBS Sports, or various other sports sites that may have archived schedules for teams in certain leagues.
